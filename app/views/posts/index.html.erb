                I've worked with many programming languages over the course of almost a decade now. My go-to language of choice is Java, which I am continuously working on my skills in. When developing web applications, I tend to rely on my skills in Ruby on Rails. I also work a lot with Android in my spare time, largely because I enjoy being the end-user reach that the Android platform provides. I have worked with Grails, PHP, JavaScript, Gosu, Python and a myriad of technologies.

                On the non-technical side of things, I enjoy keeping fit and listening to podcasts. I play videogames (Currently Street Fighter 5. I am a master Zangief player and rightfully feared in the office) and absolutely adore any kind of zombie-related media. Videogames, TV shows, books, assorted junk, it does not matter! If it includes zombies I'm all over it like peanut on butter. I also collect, assemble and paint Warhammer models when the mood takes me. Don't act surprised, you know the programmer demograph...

                Other than that, I haven't much left to say about myself. If you'd like to get in contact, my email can be found below by clicking on "contact me" (marclaffan@gmail.com). My github can also be found below, as can my LinkedIn profile and Play Store account. I currently have an ongoing project on the Play Store (You've guessed it - Zombies) that I'll be adding more to once this website goes live. If you have any feedback for it, please leave me a review. I'd appreciate it :)
